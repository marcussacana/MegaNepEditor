# MegaNepEditor - v1.0.4

Can Unpack and Repack "MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies" .cat files

This tool isn't compatible with all .cat files, tested only with the font ".\data\bootstrap\main_font.cat" and scripts files ".\data\script\scenario\*.cat"


### Usage:
- Drag and drop a .cat/.dpk file to extract
- Drag and drop a extracted cat directory to repack (Will be create with .new extension)

(To repack you can't move the directory, rename or delete the original .cat packget)

### Notes:
Files with named like "AnyHexNumber.bin" means the package don't have names of the files, you need manually discovery the .bin file type or look in the files inside "Fnames" directory

The font (.bin) is just a .dds but with aditional header data, just cut off and you can edit like any other dds, after edit put the header data again.
