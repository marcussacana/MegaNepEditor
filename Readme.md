# MegaNepEditor - v0.1

Can Unpack and Repack "MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies" .cat files

This tool isn't stable to all .cat files, tested only with the font ".\data\bootstrap\main_font.cat" and scripts files ".\data\script\scenario\*.cat"


### Usage:
- Drag and drop a .cat file to extract
- Drag and drop a extracted cat directory to repack (Will be create with .new extension)

(To repack you can't move the directory, rename or delete the original .cat packget)

### Notes:
Files with named like "AnyHexNumber.bin" means the packget don't have names of the files, you need manually discovery the .bin file type

The font (.bin) is just a .dds but with aditional header data, just cut off and you can edit like any other dds, after edit put the header data again.
